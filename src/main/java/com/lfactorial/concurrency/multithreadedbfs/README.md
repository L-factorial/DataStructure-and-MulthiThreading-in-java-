The code presented in this package demonstrates the construct for the multithread version of bfs. It has a well defined template for lock and unlock phase for picking up the task. This code does not guarantee on performance compared to the single 
threaded version of the bfs. It mostly accentuates on the construct and smooth termination of the thread once the bfs convergence is attained.
