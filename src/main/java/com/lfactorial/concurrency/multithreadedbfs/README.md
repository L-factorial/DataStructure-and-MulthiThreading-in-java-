This package contains code that demonstrates the structure for a multithreaded version of BFS. It provides a clear template for the lock and unlock phases during task assignment. While the code focuses on the proper construction and clean termination of threads upon BFS convergence, it does not guarantee better performance compared to the single-threaded version.
For a more efficient multithreaded version, stay tuned for future commits.
