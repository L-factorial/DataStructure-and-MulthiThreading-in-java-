This package contains code that demonstrates the structure for a multithreaded version of BFS. It provides a clear template for the lock and unlock phases during task assignment. While the code focuses on the proper construction and clean termination of threads upon BFS convergence, it does not guarantee better performance compared to the single-threaded version.The code presented in this package demonstrates the construct for the multithread version of bfs. It has a well defined template for lock and unlock phase for picking up the task. This code does not guarantee on performance compared to the single 
threaded version of the bfs. It mostly accentuates on the construct and smooth termination of the thread once the bfs convergence is attained. 
For a more efficient multithreaded version, stay tuned for future commits.
